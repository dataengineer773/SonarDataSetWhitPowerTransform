The sonar data set is a standard machine learning dataset for binary classifcation, at firt we load the datset and evaluate with knn on machine learning model for get a performnace accuracy and the second
step we use Box-Cox Transform  and evalute with knn and get a performace accuracy and in the next step we use Yeo-Johnson Transform and evaluate knn for get a performance accuracy and in the next step
sometimes a lift in performance can be achives by first standardizing the raw dataset prior to performance a Yeo-Johnson transform, We can explore this by adding a StabdardScaler as a first step in the pipeline
for get a accuracy
